							<p><strong>[Please refer to my Resume/CV/github for new projects. I have been lazy updating this site...]</strong></p>
							<p>I am currently pursuing MS in EE at University of Southern California, specializing in Data Science. I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in 2015. During my time at NTHU, I was the vice president and Cello principal of NTHU orchestra, chanselor of NTHU student council and an activist of Tsinghua residential college. I am also a member of Phi Tau Phi Honorary Society.</p>
							<p>I also have the privilege to spend one semester at University of Minnesota in 2014 as an exchange student, where I had wonderful experience in collaborating beyond country borders and immersing myself in American life. The coursework at Minnesota broadened my horizon in Computer Science and invigorated my interest in edgy areas like Robotics.</p>
							<p>During 2012 summer, I received scholarship and as aresult had a chance to attend Tsinghua University's summer semester. I built a "Five in a Row" board game using C++-based Qt and a raw search engine using Python.</p>

								<h2>Research Experience and Interests </h2>

							<p>At USC, I work with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rbGxNYwAAAAJ">Prof. Stefan Scherer</a>. We design and train an end-to-end conversation quality assessment system using small segments of text. Other than this, we also apply the same technique on alchoholism treatment outcome prediction.</p>

							<p>I also work with <a href="http://sunset.usc.edu/~mattmann/">Dr. Chris Mattmann</a> on using Deep Learning approach to recognize MIME types based on file byte frequency histograms.</p>

							<p>During my undergrad, I worked on Image Change Detection with <a href="http://aliensunmin.github.io/">Prof. Min Sun</a> and job scheduling on HPC clusters with <a href="http://lsalab.cs.nthu.edu.tw/home/">Prof. Jerry Chou</a>.</p>

							<p>My current research interest lies in the understanding and modeling of human dynamics and the development of math tools to help interpretability of models and for decision-making.</p>

							<p>I worked with worked with <a href="http://aliensunmin.github.io/">Prof. Min Sun</a>, specializing in image analysis. In Taiwan, or even in the whole world, Google Street View (GSV) is not updated frequently enough. Our group therefore ultimately would like to construct a system that mitigate the above issue by processing dashcam video. Briefly speaking, we segmented videos of customer-level dashboard camera into images, then conducted change detections with GSV and eventually proceeded to update the differences. Results of this project was submitted to Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2016.</p>

							<h3 style="font-size:130%;">Large-Scale System Architecture Lab.</h3>
							<br/>
							<p>I also worked with <a href="http://lsalab.cs.nthu.edu.tw/home/">Prof. Jerry Chou</a>, focusing on distributed heterogeneous cluster. We found that on different circumstances, HDD has advantage over SSD and vice versa. But HDDs are much cheaper than SSDs; thus we want to propose a system that can perceive the type of incoming job by applying machine learning on the resource usage and then move the job to proper disk. </p>
							<p>We harnessed Apache Hadoop and analyzed cluster resource usages (e.g. CPU time, I/O bandwidth, etc.) and tried to perceive the incoming job's nature (i.e. whether it is an I/O intensive, or a CPU intensive job, etc.) and finally moved the computing to the most suitable disk.</p>
							<p>This system can maximize the resource management of company data center and lower the price of building one.</p>
