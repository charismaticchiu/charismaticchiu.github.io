								<h2>About</h2>
								<a href='Resume_USC_job.pdf'>[Resume]</a>
							</header>
							<p>I am currently pursuing MS in EE at University of Southern California, specializing in Data Science and Signal Processing. I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in 2015. During my time at NTHU, I was the vice president and Cello principal of NTHU orchestra, chanselor of NTHU student council and an activist of Tsinghua residential college. I am also a member of Phi Tau Phi Honorary Society.</p>
							<p>I also have the privilege to spend one semester at University of Minnesota in 2014 as an exchange student, where I had wonderful experience in collaborating beyond country borders and immersing myself in American life. The coursework at Minnesota broadened my horizon in Computer Science and invigorated my interest in edgy areas like Robotics.</p>
							<p>During 2012 summer, I received scholarship and as aresult had a chance to attend Tsinghua University's summer semester. I built a "Five in a Row" board game using C++-based Qt and a raw search engine using Python.</p>

								<h2>Interests</h2>
							</header>

							<p>I love theory-based applications and modelling. Anything using mathematical model to tackle problems is of great interest to me. Solving real world problems using math intrigues me.</p>
							<p>
							My personal interests are in computer cognition, robotics, machine learning and high-performance computing. I am interested in understanding scene details, predicting possible outcomes (if dynamic) and also predicting human reaction. The best case is proposing an end-to-end model capable of accomplishing multiple tasks.</p>
							<p>Also, an intelligent audio system is another picture in my dream. Going multimodal is the future for me. I deem it as future, not because I am an amateur Cellist but because it is hard and challenging!</p>

								<h2>Research Experience</h2>
							</header>
							<h3 style="font-size:130%;">Visual Science Lab.</h3>
							<br/>
							<p>I worked with worked with <a href="http://aliensunmin.github.io/">Prof. Min Sun</a>, specializing in image analysis. In Taiwan, or even in the whole world, Google Street View (GSV) is not updated frequently enough. Our group therefore ultimately would like to construct a system that mitigate the above issue by processing dashcam video. Briefly speaking, we segmented videos of customer-level dashboard camera into images, then conducted change detections with GSV and eventually proceeded to update the differences. Results of this project was submitted to Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2016.</p>

							<h3 style="font-size:130%;">Large-Scale System Architecture Lab.</h3>
							<br/>
							<p>I also worked with <a href="http://lsalab.cs.nthu.edu.tw/home/">Prof. Jerry Chou</a>, focusing on distributed heterogeneous cluster. We found that on different circumstances, HDD has advantage over SSD and vice versa. But HDDs are much cheaper than SSDs; thus we want to propose a system that can perceive the type of incoming job by applying machine learning on the resource usage and then move the job to proper disk. </p>
							<p>We harnessed Apache Hadoop and analyzed cluster resource usages (e.g. CPU time, I/O bandwidth, etc.) and tried to perceive the incoming job's nature (i.e. whether it is an I/O intensive, or a CPU intensive job, etc.) and finally moved the computing to the most suitable disk.</p>
							<p>This system can maximize the resource management of company data center and lower the price of building one.</p>
